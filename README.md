# netflix-movie-recommender

In this project, I will be using data from the well-known [Netflix Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data) to recommend movies to users. However, I will be taking a novel approach to enhance these predictions using graph machine learning that accounts for the relationships between users, movies, actors, and directors. I will do this by adding data from [IMDB](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/).
